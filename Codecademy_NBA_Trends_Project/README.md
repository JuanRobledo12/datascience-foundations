# NBA Data Analysis Project

## Project Description

In this project, we analyze NBA data from 538 and Basketball Reference to explore associations between teams, win rates, and playoff appearances. The dataset includes information on five teams and various performance metrics, with additional variables added for a comprehensive analysis. We created several charts and tables to visualize the findings.
